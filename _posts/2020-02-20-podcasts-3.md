Dear Crypto Community and Blockchain buddies across the globe,

In this episode, we are pleased to present you with Ciara Sun, Chief of Staff at Huobi Global, one of the most famous exchanges out there. Ciara went from working at BCG (Boston Consulting Group) to the Blockchain Space - one that she describes as exciting, young and burgeoning.

Ciara reveals the different ways in which blockchain technology is slowly being adopted in major cities in China, the importance of regulation and licenses for Crypto exchanges. We also cover CRITICAL and HOT topics such as DeFi or Decentralized Finance vs. CeFi / Centralized finance. Which do you think has the highest potential of helping mass adoption? 

Last but not least, we go over some of the core utilities of the Huobi token that has been one of the best performing tokens in 2019 and has been continuing the trend in 2020. Hear more about the HT token and let us know your thoughts.
