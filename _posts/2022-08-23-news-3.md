8Sian, a Malaysian NFT project launched in 2021, features a collection of 8,888 artworks that beautifully depict Asian women, each artwork intricately detailed and historically significant. This collection, now owned by over 4,000 buyers, is a celebration of the rich diversity and cultural heritage of women across Asia. Yap's appearance on Tatler TV: Meta Versed Season 2 shed light on the project's origins and its ambitious trajectory.


The project has not only garnered support from major brands like Uniqlo, Dolce & Gabbana, and Tommy Hilfiger but has also made a splash at Decentraland's Metaverse Fashion Week, showcasing the potential for collaboration between traditional fashion powerhouses and digital platforms. Yap's efforts have led to a partnership with the billion-dollar online apparel shopping platform Cider, further solidifying 8Sian's influence in the digital fashion space.

Yap's mission extends beyond aesthetics; it's about cultural preservation and education. She aims for future generations to see themselves represented in the Metaverse, a space where diversity is not just acknowledged but celebrated. The 8Sian avatars, adorned with elements from Cambodian headpieces to Taiwanese bubble tea, embody the multifaceted beauty of Asian cultures.

As the fashion industry stands on the cusp of a digital revolution, with meta humans poised to take over runways, Yap's 8Sian is at the forefront, developing a virtual interactive museum and a 3D model that could become an NFT influencer. Despite the challenges of a largely unregulated Metaverse, Yap remains focused on the positive impact of technology and the vast opportunities it presents.

Nicole Yap's journey with 8Sian is a testament to the power of resilience and the importance of representation. It's a narrative that not only inspires but also paves the way for a more inclusive and diverse digital future.
