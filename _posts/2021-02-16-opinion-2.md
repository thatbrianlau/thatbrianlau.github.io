Have you ever wondered why every app looks and feels the same?

Rounded sans-serif fonts… packaged as a custom wordmark, like Goldman Sans (i wish this were a parody site but alas…)

Bold “whimsical” statements and provocative images…

Minimal interfaces and stripped down choices…

Clean workflows…

Everything looks and feels the same. Simple. Sleek. Safe.
