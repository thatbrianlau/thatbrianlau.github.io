I’ve recently been exploring the evolving market microstructure around NFTs, and a recent discussion on the merits of platforms like Sudoswap has highlighted some of the inherent tension between the current NFT audience and the future of the asset class. There is a massive wave of platforms coming that bring more robust market structure oriented towards traders to NFTs, and soon, other esoteric assets. The evolution of NFT market structure provides a helpful understanding of where all markets are trending, over time, as a result of technology innovation and new models for financialization.

In this post, I’ll highlight why market ineffiencies exist, why market microstructure matters, and why NFTs are not immune to arbitrage. Inefficient markets will always be arbitraged by clever traders who see the opportunity for profit. In many markets, this may take decades, or even centuries. The inherently digital nature of NFTs supercharges this process and accelerates this timeline, just as we saw with bitcoin and later, tokens. I’ll also share some brief thoughts on the future of culture as capital and cultural arbitrage from a markets perspective, and how efficient markets can help remove the grift that is so prevalent in emerging asset classes. Giddy up!
